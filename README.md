### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Test the input of a simple submit type form. If the input given by the user is not 13, it's accepted, otherwise it's not. The users get notified with a message from a pop-up window if it's not accepted. Otherwise, get notified with a message from a pop-up window for their successful submission, giving them the choice to try a different number. 
- Experience this app in both mobile and desktop design.
